# Logistic-Regression-Analysis-Over-the-Titanic
This project is over the Titanic kaggle set and focuses on predicting what traits in a passenger aboard the Titanic lead to better chances of survival. All analysis is done in R.

### Analysis includes:
  * Building a logistic regression model
  * Refining the model
  * Check assumptions of a logistic regression 
  * Interpreting output
  * Visualizing the model
  * Predict odds of survival based on certain features
